# neat-cars
This is a simple but not perfect implemented example of the [NEAT Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies).
In this example a large swarm of cars learn to navigate through a limited road described by a picture in the color #A2AA9F.

It lacks the NEAT-typical species implementation, but because this is such a simple case no complex topologies are required to get the task done.
